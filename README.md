Follow these steps to run the VBA script to re-analyze/re-populate the stock data.

1. Download and open [this Excel-Macro file](https://github.com/anulkar/VBA-challenge/blob/master/VBAStocks/AtulNulkar_Multiple_year_stock_data_solved.xlsm) containing yearly stock data: 
2. On the worksheet named **2016**, click on the first button to clear the stock analysis data from all worksheets in columns I through Q.
3. Once the data is cleared, on the same **2016** worksheet, click on the second button to run the stock analysis VBA script for all worksheets.
4. It should take under a minute for the code to finish running, and after its complete, a message will pop-up indicating how many seconds/minutes it took to run.
